# To_Do_List
This Project is the first Task assigned to me during my Internship at InternPe.

I have succefully made used of HTML, CSS, and Javascript.

1. HTML is used to make basic HTML structure of the To_Do_List. Appropriate tags are used to define different sections, such as the input-area, add-button, and other elements.

2. I have applied CSS Styling to make the complete design visually appealing. Designing the layout, color, and typography is done to make it user-friendly and good-looking. Various CSS classes and IDs are used to target specific elements for styling.

3. Javascript Fuctionalities made it possible to gain lots of required functions like :-
3.1 Applying Add Functionality.Using it we can maintain a list of tasks to be done.

3.2. Applying Delete Functionality. These functionalities allows to remove the task that is completed.

3.3. Line-Through Functionality allows not to edit the task that is completed and red line indicates its already done.
